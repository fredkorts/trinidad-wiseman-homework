# Trinidad Wiseman Homework

A React single-page application bootstrapped with Vite and TypeScript. The project pairs Ant Design UI components with React Query-driven data fetching and includes tooling for unit tests and linting.

## ðŸš€ Live Demo

Check out the live application: **[https://trinidad-wiseman-homework.vercel.app/](https://trinidad-wiseman-homework.vercel.app/)**

## Tech Stack

- **Framework:** [React 19](https://react.dev/) with [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) for routing
- **Build tooling:** [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) with TypeScript and vite-tsconfig-paths
- **UI library:** [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) and Ant Design Icons
- **Data fetching:** [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) with [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)
- **Testing:** [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) with Testing Library
- **Code quality:** ESLint (TypeScript + React rules) and Prettier

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18 or newer (LTS recommended)
- **npm** 9 or newer (ships with Node.js installs)

You can confirm your versions with:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
2. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The Vite dev server runs on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) by default.
3. _(Optional)_ **Start the mock API** used during development
   ```bash
   npm run mock
   ```
   The mock server listens on port `8888`. You can run it alongside the Vite dev server in a separate terminal.

## Available Scripts

| Command              | Description                                                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`        | Start the Vite development server with hot module reloading.        |
| `npm run mock`       | Launch the local mock API server on port 8888.                      |
| `npm run build`      | Type-check the project and generate a production build.             |
| `npm run preview`    | Preview the production build locally after running `npm run build`. |
| `npm run lint`       | Run ESLint across the codebase.                                     |
| `npm test`           | Execute the Vitest unit test suite once.                            |
| `npm run test:watch` | Run Vitest in watch mode for rapid feedback while developing.       |

## Running Tests

### Unit and Component Tests (Vitest)

Vitest is configured via `vitest.setup.ts`. You can run all tests in a single pass or start the interactive watcher:

```bash
npm test
# or for watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Linting

Ensure code style and quality checks pass before committing:

```bash
npm run lint
```

## Project Structure Highlights

- `src/` â€“ Application source code (components, hooks, routes, and styles)
- `public/` â€“ Static assets copied as-is to the build output
- `mock.server.js` â€“ Express-based mock API used during local development
